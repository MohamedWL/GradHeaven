# Grad Heaven
### An app where newly graduates, students or other individuals with fewer experience can find jobs to kickstart their careers.

## Expo Router Example

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## 🚀 How to use

```sh
npx create-react-native-app -t with-router
```
#### You will also have to get yourself a Rapid_API_Key from https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch and either put it in a .env or directly enter it in the /hook/useFetch.js
